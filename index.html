<h3> About Me </h3>
<p>My name is Anthony Moran, an experienced Chartered Engineer, and Business Development Director from Manchester.</p>
<p>My interest in code has always been there since being exposed through my background and career. I've always wanted to give it a go, and find out if it was a career that I could get into at some point.</p>
